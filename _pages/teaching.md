I have helped teach the following courses as a teaching assistant in IIT Bombay:
1. MA109 (Calculus): Fall 2020
2. CS213(M) (Data Structures and Algorithms): Spring 2021
3. CS228(M) (Logic For Computer Science): Autumn 2021

I will soon be adding webpages for each course where all the material that I have created for the courses will be uploaded.
