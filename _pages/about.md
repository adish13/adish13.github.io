Hello there! 

I am Pradipta Bora, a third year undergrad at the [Department Of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitb.ac.in) at the Indian Institute Of Technology Bombay. I am fascinated and interested in almost all fields of computer science and currently I am exploring the fields of algorithms, image processing and deep learning. I have experience in software development, machine learning, competitive programming and algorithmic trading.

I am going to intern with Jane Street Capital in Summer 2022 from their Hong Kong office. I am looking forward to applying functional programming for solving real world problems.

I am currently associated with the Computational Geometry group at the Department of Computer Science at TU Braunschweig where I have interned under Professor [Sandor Fekete](https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/fekete/).

I have been a Teaching Assistant for a lot of courses at IIT Bombay. Presently I am a TA for CS228M, Logic For Computer Science. You can access the resources that I have created for the courses I am helping teach to learn more about them [here]({{ '/teaching' | relative_url }}).

Feel free to contact me and do go through the website to know more about my [projects](/projects) and do read my blog posts. I have authored a few articles related to Reverse Engineering for the Cybersecurity club of the CSE Department that you can access on this site [on this link]({{ '/blog/' | relative_url }} ). You can also check out by Curriculum Vitae [here]({{ '/cv.pdf' | relative_url }}).
