Hello there! 

I am Adish Shah, a third year undergrad at the [Department Of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitb.ac.in) at the Indian Institute Of Technology Bombay. 
I am widely interested in almost all fields of computer science and currently I am exploring systems and ML related domains like cloud computing, ASR and blockchain.

I will be interning at Quadeye as a systems intern in the summer of 2023. 

At IIT Bombay, I have been a Teaching Assistant for a bunch of courses. Most recently, I was a TA for CS228M, Logic For Computer Science. More about this [here]({{ '/teaching' | relative_url }}).
