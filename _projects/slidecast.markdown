This project aims at reducing the size of video files used to deliver lectures based on presentations. We created a platform that allowed a lecturer to record his lectures in a format that preserves the audio along with the mouse and keyboard events to simulate the entire presentation without storing any video information.

We developed a cross platform Python application to record mouse events and lecture slide information with
voice data to create a format that removes the need for video capture while delivering lecture videos which was then replaced by a more versatile and usable Progressive Web Application.
We achieved size reduction by a factor of 20 on average compared to recorded lectures captured using screen recorders.
