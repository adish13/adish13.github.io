Here I implemented Neural Networks for hand written digit recognition in Python for recognising the numbers
in the sudoku which was used with a C++ sudoku solver script to automatically solve sudokus
I also used OpenCV based processing algorithms to isolate the sudoku which is then fed into the neural network
Finally, I had to implement convolutional neural networks in Keras to improve accuracy of the recognising model.
