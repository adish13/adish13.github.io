In this project, I implemented a web scrapper to fetch word meanings, synonyms and antonyms from WordNet and Google and then created a simple to use python API wrapper for the interface and published it as an open source python module.
This module was published on the Python Package Index and it has achieved 154 stars on GitHub and 49,000 downloads per month on average.
