In this project I used OpenGL in C++ to create a real time planet rendering system for the Earth and it’s atmosphere.
I also implemented Blinn-Phong and Phong lighting models to provide accurate reflections from the Earth’s surface.
The Atmospheric Shaders were based on Rayleigh and Mie scattering to simulate the atmosphere accurately.
