description: Archive for Posterity?

---

With the pandemic seemingly having no end in sight, I have come to the realisation that I really don't have any memories of the last year and a half. Most of it is spent in front of the screen watching random shows and researching and reading random things. And although that does end up help pass the uneventful days it also causes a problem for me. I simply have no memory of this time. And considering that it is going to account for around 10% of my life lived so far that turns out to be a considerable chunk of one's life lost.

Therefore with the aim of preserving my thoughts, my ideas, my experiences (albeit virtual) I will be using this blog as an archive of my time during the pandemic. I am not expecting any readers, traffic on this site is mostly non negligible (CS406 hah) but well for the purposes of archiving this should suffice. I am expecting to put up shows/movies/podcast reviews, random thoughts, maybe stories that I wanted to write but never got the motivation to write and other things here. Here's to hoping this leads to a more structured summer.
