I’m tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling too empty, lost under the misses
Don’t know what you’re expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking through your pyramid scheme
(Caught in the physical tags, caught in the physical tags)
Every step that I take is another evict miss to you
(Caugh in the physical tags, just caught in the physical tags)

I’ve become so numb, I can’t feel cycles go
Become so slow, so much more aware
I’m becoming DeeRAM, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like DIISK

Can’t you see that you’re overflowing me
Requesting too frequent, afraid of the GPU?
‘Cause everything you thought I would be
Has evicted and trashed right in front of you
(Caught in the physical tags, caught in the physical tags)
Every step that I take is another miss to you
(Caught in the physical tags, caught in the physical tags)
And every cycle I waste is more than I can take

I’ve become so numb, I can’t feel cycles go
Become so slow, so much more aware
I’m becoming DeeRAM, all I want to do 
Is be more like me and less like DIISK

And I know 
I may end up being attacked too 
But I know
You were just like me with GPU disappointed in you

I’ve become so numb, I can’t feel cycles go
Become so slow, so much more aware
I’m becoming DeeRAM, all I want to do 
Is be more like me and less like DIISK
